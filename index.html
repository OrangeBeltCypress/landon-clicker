<h3>DogDay is a toy produced by Playtime Co. debuting as a minor antagonist in Chapter 3: Deep Sleep. DogDay is the proclaimed leader of the Smiling Critters, which later stood after being transferred as an experiment for the Bigger Bodies Initiative.DogDay originally coexisted in harmony with the Smiling Critters group, each having their own corresponding Bigger Bodies experiment. Following the events that took place during The Hour of Joy, the gang began to drift apart, leaving DogDay as the sole survivor. CatNap then imprisoned DogDay in a concealed cell within the Playhouse, subjecting him to endless torment due to his disobedience to The Prototype.The Ruined Critters make slightly distorted but high-pitched giggling and screeching noises wherever they walk, eerily sounding like children. Later on, several Mini Critters crawl inside of Bigger Bodies DogDay's exposed torso to puppeteer him into chasing the Player. Since they are starving, it is presumed that the Mini Critters devoured DogDay after failing to catch and consume the Player. Perhaps they also sought to kill DogDay because he refused to side with CatNap They are never seen or heard from again in the rest of the chapter, but may be seen again in the future, given they are still alive.</h3>
